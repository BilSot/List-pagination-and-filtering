# List-pagination-and-filtering

This project is part of the Treehouse Techdegree program.
It should split the students' info list on multiple pages and the user should be able to filter the list, by typing a term in the 
serch textbox, displayed in the top right corner of the page. The results from the filtering will be appied on the whole list, 
not only for the selected page.
